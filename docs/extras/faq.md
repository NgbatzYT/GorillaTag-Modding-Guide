## Modding Questions

### Isn't modding the game cheating? {docsify-ignore}

!> The use of mods that interfere with gameplay inside public lobbies is forbidden by the developers and can result in a ban. Please keep mods contained to modded lobbies with Utilla. **Most gameplay-changing mods automatically disable joining public lobbies, but please be careful.**

### Where can I get mods? {docsify-ignore}

**For PC:** Open Monke Mod Manager and select the checkboxes besides the mods you'd like to install, and then hit the *Install/Update* button.  
For mods outside of Monke Mod Manager, download them, whether it be from GitHub, the [GorillaTag Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv) **#pc-mods** forum, or other sources. **Make sure to download any dependencies required by the mod.**

**For Quest:** Mods are no longer supported for quest.

## Game Questions

### What is Gorilla Tag? {docsify-ignore}

From the developer:

> Reject humanity.
>
> Run, climb, and jump in VR using a unique locomotion method that only needs the movement of your hands and arms. No buttons, no sticks, no teleportation. Push off of surfaces to jump and squeeze them with both hands to climb. The game mode is simple tag, for up to 3 players, or infection mode, with 4 or more. Run from the infected gorillas, or outmaneuver the survivors to catch them. Parkour up trees and cliff faces to evade and chase people down. Hang out in a virtual, low-fi jungle with randos or group up in a private room with friends to hang out and play. The stakes are low, so feel free to just chat or make up your own games. The movement is easy to learn, and hard to master. Crossplay with the PCVR & Quest version of the game, so play with anyone, anywhere.

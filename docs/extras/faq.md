## Modding Questions

### Isn't modding the game cheating? {docsify-ignore}

!> The use of mods that interfere with gameplay inside public lobbies is forbidden by the developers and can result in a ban. Please keep mods contained to modded lobbies with Utilla. **Most gameplay-changing mods automatically disable joining public lobbies, but please be careful.**

### Where can I get mods? {docsify-ignore}

**For PC:** Open Monke Mod Manager and select the checkboxes besides the mods you'd like to install, and then hit the *Install/Update* button.  
For mods outside of Monke Mod Manager, download them, whether it be from GitHub, the [GorillaTag Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv) **#pc-mods** forum, or other sources. **Make sure to download any dependencies required by the mod.**

**For Quest:** Mods are no longer supported for quest.

### What's the difference between cheating and modding?
This is the Gorilla Tag Modding Groups view on it.

Cheating is prohibited by the developers of the game, and goes against the Gorilla Tag intellectual property. (read more at https://gorillatagvr.com/gorillatagvr-mod-policy/)

#### What is cheating?
Cheating is including but not limited to:
* Using mods that work in non-modded lobbies
* Unless it client-sided/only visible for other modders, like Gorilla Shirts
* Using cheats
* Cheats being something like tag gun, tag all and such. They’re not allowed in modded lobbies either. Mainly seen in mod menus.
* Player tracking
* Tracking is targeting a specific user to get their room code and if they’re online or not.
* Cheating and Modding are not the same thing.

What happens if I do it anyway?
* You’ll get banned from the game, GTMG and most likely also the official Gorilla Tag Discord server.
* You will have a high chance of installing malicious software as cheat creators usually ship malware with cheats.

#### How do I know if this mod is a cheat?
Well to be on the safe side, we recommend only using mods from this server or Monke Mod Manager. (type ?mmm to get a link)
If you want to be extra sure, then make sure it doesn’t go against anything in the What is cheating? section. Or just ask one of our trusted or verified modders!

We encourage you to not to use or install cheats, as it’s ruining the game and our will to keep modding. Please Mod Responsibly!

#### You can use the command !modding in GTMG for AA's official views on it.

## Game Questions

### What is Gorilla Tag? {docsify-ignore}

From the developer:

> Reject humanity.
>
> Run, climb, and jump in VR using a unique locomotion method that only needs the movement of your hands and arms. No buttons, no sticks, no teleportation. Push off of surfaces to jump and squeeze them with both hands to climb. The game mode is simple tag, for up to 3 players, or infection mode, with 4 or more. Run from the infected gorillas, or outmaneuver the survivors to catch them. Parkour up trees and cliff faces to evade and chase people down. Hang out in a virtual, low-fi jungle with randos or group up in a private room with friends to hang out and play. The stakes are low, so feel free to just chat or make up your own games. The movement is easy to learn, and hard to master. Crossplay with the PCVR & Quest version of the game, so play with anyone, anywhere.
